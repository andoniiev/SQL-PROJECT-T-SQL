# SQL-PROJECT-T-SQL
My university project rewritten in T-SQL
The  project must contain:
• entity relationship diagram (from last semester)
• DDL scripts for MS SQL Server and ORACLE from a diagram of your own project
• DML scripts filling the tables with sample data (several records per table)
• at least two procedures in each environment (ORACLE and MS SQL Server)
• at least two triggers in each environment (ORACLE and MS SQL Server)

Triggers and procedures in different environments can have the same functionality. 
In one of these objects the cursor must be used - in T-SQL it can be in a trigger or procedure, in PL / SQL in a procedure. In PL / SQL, one of the triggers must be FOR EACH ROW.
